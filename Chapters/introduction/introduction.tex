\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

\gls{iot} is a relatively new concept that already has applications in many domains, creating new ways of interactions between humans and small devices, referred to as smart devices. \gls{iot} is being hailed as one of the primary catalysts of the next digital revolution. The technology enablesÂ connecting ubiquitous objects to the internet. The advancement of digital technologies, such as low-cost but highly capable sensors and processors, efficient wireless protocols, the mobile revolution, and a plethora of startups and established companies developing the necessary application and management software, are all contributing to the rise of IoT.
Applications like Smart Airports, Transportation, Home Automation, and more areas are being revolutionized by this technology \cite{marksteiner2017overview}.
\gls{iot} is the deployment of network-connected devices that interact with the physical environment by employing sensors to collect data, managing other systems, controlling actuators, as well as communicating with one another. Typically, an IoT solution's architecture incorporates constrained devices, gateways or border routers, and cloud-based services. Constrained devices are classified into three classes depending on their degree resources such as processing capability, memory, power supply, communication capability and user interfaces \cite{rfc7228}. Constrained devices may induce bottlenecks in the network and thus the network becomes a constrained network. However, constrained devices may also be operating in naturally constrained networks. Furthermore, depending on their class, they may be assumed to not be able to process sophisticated or even conventional cryptographic operations. In many use cases, the \gls{iot} devices handle critical and private data. This imposes the requirement for data integrity and authenticity guarantees, confidentiality of information, and privacy of users. Hence, the development in the field of \gls{iot} is challenging due to the nature of the limited environment.
\par
There is no consensus on security in IoT since the application of standard secure communication protocol solutions is not directly possible. That is due to such solutions' expensive and resource-consuming operations, the constrained nature, and the scalability of IoT devices. For example \gls{tls} \cite{rfc5246}, which relies on \gls{tcp}, has been criticized as inappropriate for constrained \gls{iot} devices \cite{shang2016challenges}. Among the reasons are, the infeasibility of \gls{iot} devices to maintain long-lived connections due to energy constraints, high header overhead, and the low-latency requirement that is opposed by the delay due to \gls{tcp} handshake, especially in a lossy network. Nonetheless, research and development and continuously introducing functional alternatives. 
Alternatively, \gls{dtls} \cite{dtls} provides security for communication channels relying on \gls{udp}. In contrast to \gls{tcp}, \gls{udp} is more suitable for \gls{iot}. It is an unreliable protocol as it does not care about message delivery , resulting in a lower header overhead. In addition, it introduces less traffic to the network. On that basis, the \gls{ietf} introduced \gls{coap} \cite{rfc7252} that is intended to be a generic application protocol for constrained environments. Similar to the ubiquitous HTTP \cite{http}, \gls{coap} realizes a subset of the \gls{rest} architecture. Therefore, it easily translates to HTTP. Moreover, \gls{coap} leverages \gls{udp} as its transport layer protocol which is secured by \gls{dtls}. Hence, \gls{coap} is one of well-suited protocol alternatives for HTTP/TLS for \gls{iot}. Nevertheless, no single solution is perfect for all use cases as each has its own challenges and requirements.
\par
Security is an essential aspect of the different phases of the lifecycle of an IoT device. In addition to discussing the risks to a thing's security and the challenges that may be encountered in protecting against these threats, Garcia-Morchon et al. \cite{rfc8576} discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing. The lifecycle of a thing is classified into four phases, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:iot-lifecycle}. In particular, our thesis is primarily focused on discussing the security of the bootstrapping phase and management of cryptographic keys during the operational phase to ensure desired security features for the utilized keys. Key management encapsulates the generation, exchange, storage, usage and replacement of cryptographic keys.
