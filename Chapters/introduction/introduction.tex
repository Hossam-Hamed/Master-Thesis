\section{Structure of the Thesis}\label{sec:structure_of_the_thesis}

The structure of this thesis is as follows: In chapter \ref{ch:background}, we reflect on principles relevant to the understanding of the work presented in further chapters. In addition to other works related to our thesis. 
Next we propose real-world use cases in chapter \ref{ch:usecases} where the protocols to be proposed can be applied.
In chapter \ref{ch:secureBootstrapping}, we give an overview of the two promising automated bootstrapping protocols: \gls{brski} and \gls{sztp}. Moreover, we present a comparative study between them.
Chapter \ref{ch:postcomp} discusses post-compromise security, and how it is achievable in an asynchronous environment through the use of \gls{x3dh} and double ratcheting. 
In chapter \ref{ch:implementation} we present our demo implementation of the protocols discussed in chapter \ref{ch:secureBootstrapping}.
Furthermore, chapter \ref{ch:discussion} discusses our findings and reflects the represented protocols on the use cases.
Finally, chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes our work and introduces suggestions for future work.
