\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I sincerely thank Prof. Dr. Jorge Cu\'{e}llar for his continuous guidance, endless support, and patience. I have benefited immensely from your wealth of knowledge throughout this master's degree. It has been my pleasure to be your student and work under your supervision. I would also like to express my appreciation to the University of Passau, specifically the chair of IT-Security.

I am incredibly grateful for my family's unconditional, unequivocal, and loving support that they give in all possible forms. Without their encouragement and prayers in each and every step of this journey, it would not have been possible. Nonetheless, I want to express my gratitude to my dear friend Franz Stimmer for his continuous support and encouragement since the day when coming to Germany was just an idea.

Last but not least, I would like to show my appreciation for the incredible friends I have made over the past years through this journey. You have made hard days bearable and good days even better.
