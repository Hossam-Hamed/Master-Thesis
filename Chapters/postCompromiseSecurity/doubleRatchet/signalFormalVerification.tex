\section{Formal Verification of Signal Protocol}
For completeness, we mention below former work related aimed at formally analyzing the Signal protocol without diving into details.

Cohn-Gordon et al. \cite{cohn2020formal} were the first to address Signal's security in a formal manner. The verification methodology is highly comprehensive and sophisticated, and it is designed particularly for the Signal protocol \cite{alwen_coretti_dodis_2020}. A completely adversarially controlled network is used to evaluate the protocol. Through the definition of a security model, the research covers Signal's \gls{x3dh} and Double Ratchet protocols as a multi-stage authenticated key exchange protocol. The model depicts the ratcheting key update structure as a multi-stage model, where instead of just a sequence, it is a tree-like structure of stages that reflect the chains in Signal. The model enables different parties to run numerous, simultaneous sessions, each with its own set of stages. Secrecy and authentication of message keys in the computational model, under a rich compromise scenario, are the high-level features targeted to be verified by hand. Nevertheless, forward and future secrecy are implied goals, as derived session keys should be kept secret in a range of compromise circumstances. For instance, if a long-term secret is compromised but a medium or ephemeral secret is not, or if a state is compromised and a secure asymmetric stage happens afterwards. Since Signal does not cleanly separate key exchange from subsequent data messages, the model had to reorder some procedures to achieve this separation. In addition and contrary to Signal, the model does not re-use \gls{dh} keys for signatures. Finally, the research shows that Signal's cryptographic core delivers the desirable security attributes specified in the security model, based on normal cryptographic assumptions. Reassuringly, its design is free of any severe defects. The model, on the other hand, does not address Signal's instantaneous decryption feature, which is a distinctive feature that privileges it to other protocols that lack it \cite{alwen_coretti_dodis_2020}. Furthermore, because the model is exclusive to the Signal protocol, it cannot be used as a reference notion for \gls{rke} because it provides a lower degree of security than would be expected for \gls{rke} \cite{poettering2018asynchronous}.
