Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution, refers to the 21st century's swift advances in technology, industry, and societal patterns and processes. Industry 4.0 is the concept of using automation and data exchange in manufacturing. Nine pillars of technologies make up Industry 4.0; among them are the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Cybersecurity. These technologies are used to create a ``smart factory" where sensors, machines, systems, and humans communicate with each other in order to control and monitor progress throughout the manufacturing process digitally.

IIoT is a method of digitally transforming manufacturing. It relies on a network of sensors to gather essential production data, then leverages linked systems and infrastructure to transform that data into beneficial insights about the effectiveness of the industrial processes. Likewise, Cybersecurity is a vital foundation of IIoT. Industry 4.0 and IoT demand linking together independent devices and systems from possibly different vendors while one deviceâ€™s action is based on the output of another device. This translates to a substantial increase in connectivity directly related to an increase in the risk of potential cyber-attacks.
IoT devices in the industrial realm interact and generate an enormous amount of data in different aspects. For example, employees' wearable devices to share information, alerts, and monitor their health status, smart production line machines, inventory environment sensors, and connected transportation vehicles.	The data within IIoT environments is critically sensitive as it directly affects employees', customers', and manufacturers' privacy, manufacturer's operations and market competitiveness, and functional safety.
A relevant incident that highlights the importance of cybersecurity in the industrial field is the infamous Stuxnet attack\footnote{https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/}. It is an attack against an Iranian uranium enrichment plant where the attack technically manipulated the enrichment centrifuges causing them to fail. Therefore, it is crucial for industrial information systems and manufacturing processes against cyber threats as a security breach can affect multiple areas, from supply chain to operations.
