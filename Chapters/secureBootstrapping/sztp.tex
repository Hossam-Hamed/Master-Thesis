\section{\acrfull*{sztp}}
\gls{sztp} is as well an outcome of the \gls{ietf} group. 
It introduces a bootstrapping technique for devices in initial factory state.
It aims at securely supplying networking devices with bootstrapping data without further actions required other than physical placement and connecting the power and network cables.
\gls{sztp} is primarily concerned with physical devices, however, it has the potential to be extended to logical entities like virtual machines. 
The protocol is not limited to provisioning trust anchors to the device but rather can update the device's boot, commit an initial configuration, and execute arbitrary scripts to handle auxiliary requirements.
