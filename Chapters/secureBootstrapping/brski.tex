%intro
\gls{brski} is a product of the ANIMA working group of the \gls{ietf}. It is an automated bootstrapping protocol that enables an unconfigured device to discover and securely join an unfamiliar network domain it is installed in. \gls{brski} results in the device device acquiring an X.509 root certificate to authenticate the network domains' elements and establish consecutive secure channels. Moreover, the device can use the obtained certificate to perform further certificate enrollment protocols, like \gls{est} \cite{rfc7030}. \gls{brski} is capable of realizing a large scale of thousands of devices in a risk prone environment. For example, customer devices provided by ISPs which are directly shipped to the customers.
