The term ``Bootstrapping" is used in a spectrum of contexts including Computing, Law, Finance\footfullcite{bs-wiki}. It is inspired from the late idiom ``to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps" which means to succeed or elevate yourself without any outside help. In the context of Networking, bootstrapping is an initial procedure between an unconfigured devices which intend to communicate with a network for the first time. Its goal is to provide the device with the required information that enables it to establish subsequent secure communication channels with the desired network.
